This is my note when having my hands on docker hub CI/CD features 
i.e. 
[00 auto build docker image on the event of new push occurred on a given branch](./doc/00.autobuild-dockerimage-onbranchnewpush/readme.md)
01 auto reload docker image via web hook to update a running container on the cloud

ref. 
I base my work in this repo on this repo ref. https://github.com/trangtruong1610/docker_action
